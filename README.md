## 📌 Why This Project Was Needed  
Most businesses store fragmented supply chain data across spreadsheets, making it hard to answer questions like:

- Which city drives the highest sales?
- Which product category performs best?
- Which supplier is cost-effective?
- Where are the delays happening?

This dashboard consolidates all supply chain metrics into **a single interactive Excel file**, using **Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, and Power Query** for easy exploration.
